# Single image haze removal
### Mingjue Wang

The propose of this repository is to implement the image haze removal base on the Kaiming HE. [paper](http://projectsweb.cs.washington.edu/research/insects/CVPR2009/award/hazeremv_drkchnl.pdf).

## Usage

The code can be executed via exe application

## Summary from the article.
This dehaze algorithm contains three steps,

1) Find the dark chanel
2) Estimate transmission map
3) Determine intensity of atmospheric light
4) Clarify image

First, the intensity of atmospheric light `A` is estimated form hazed image `I(x)`. Then, the transmission map `t(x)` is estimated using `A` and `I(x)`. Finally, the image is clarified with the image defogging model.

#### Step#1 Find the dark chanel:
Based on the input image, setup a block size. Then find the dark channel (lowest intensity).

#### Step#2 Estimate transmission map:
We need to create a transmission map. We will use the result of the dark channel to create the `t(x)`. Based on the article the function looks like following. ```t(x) = 1 â€“ defog * darkchannel / AirLight```. Here the defog is a value between 0 to 1. This value would create the image depth.

#### Step#3 Estimate intensity of atmospheric light:
In order to find the intensity of atmospheric light, we pick the 0.1% haze pixels in the dark chnnel, then we compare with the original image then we pick the highest intensity value as the atmospheric light.

#### Step#4 Clarify image:
Finally, the image is clarified by: ```J(x)=(I(x)- A)/max(t(x), t0)+A```

Where `J(x)` is output, `I(x)` is input, `t(x)` is transmission map, `A` is atmospheric light and `t0` is set to a constant value to avoid dividing by zero.

### You need to have the Visual Studio to build the exe:
Import all the courses into the Visual studio. Then run the build. You need to change the build to use the release instead of the debug mode. After you have the exe you can run it like the normal Microsoft Applications

Steps to build the release at visual studio
