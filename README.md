# Single image haze removal
### Mingjue Wang

The propose of this repository is to implement the image haze removal base on the Kaiming HE. [paper](http://projectsweb.cs.washington.edu/research/insects/CVPR2009/award/hazeremv_drkchnl.pdf).

## Usage

The code can be executed via .exe

## Summary from the article.
This dehaze algorithm contains three steps,

1) Determine intensity of atmospheric light
2) Estimate transmission map
3) Clarify image

First, the intensity of atmospheric light `A` is estimated form hazed image `I(x)`. Then, the transmission map `t(x)` is estimated using `A` and `I(x)`. Finally, the image is clarified with the image defogging model.

#### Step#1 Estimate intensity of atmospheric light:
Find the top 0.1% brightest pixels in the dark channel then choose one with highest intensity as the representing of atmospheric light.

#### Step#2 Estimate transmission map:
First, find a dark channel based on a local area(coarsemap)
Then, the transmission map `t(x)` is thereby obtained:

```t(x) = 1 â€“ defoggingParam * darkPixelFromCoarseMap / AtmosphericLightIntensity```

The ```defoggingParam``` is a value between 0 to 1. The higher value the lesser amount of fog would be kept for the distant objects.

#### Step#3 Clarify image:
Finally, the image is clarified by: ```J(x)=(I(x)- A)/max(t(x), t0)+A```

Where `J(x)` is output, `I(x)` is input, `t(x)` is transmission map, `A` is atmospheric light and `t0` is set to a constant value to avoid dividing by zero.

### You need to have the Visual Studio to build the exe:
After you have the exe you can run it like the normal Microsoft Applications
